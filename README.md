Description:
The task involves implementing a sentiment analysis model using logistic regression on the IMDb movie review dataset. The process includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. We start by loading the necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, nltk, and matplotlib. Then, we load the IMDb dataset from Kaggle ("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews") and inspect its structure and class distribution. Data preprocessing involves removing stopwords, punctuation, and converting text to lowercase. The sentiment labels are converted to binary values for model training.

We then vectorize the text data using TF-IDF and split the dataset into training and testing sets. We train a logistic regression model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test set using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, implementing a sentiment analysis model using logistic regression on the IMDb dataset demonstrates the fundamental steps involved in text classification tasks. The model achieves a certain level of accuracy in predicting sentiment labels. Further improvements could be explored by tuning hyperparameters or trying different machine learning algorithms.
